Quick Info
=======================
This homework meet the every requirement of the hw3. I finished all the parts including the two bonus part. Every function works well. And I think every condition has been handled well. I used two third party files which are SDWebImage for image showing and MBProgress for the waiting part. Except them, I finished all other parts of the homework by myself.

=======================
File Highlights (most of the code is here)
=======================
1.Three tabs with their views. First type name, type and distance to make the request. When you are waiting the results, you can cancel the request and then you can make some change.

2.When request is finished, you can switch between map and list to see the results.

3.In the list view, you can tab on single cell to enter the detail view for each result. You can press “Add to favorites” to save the place. Then you can view it later by pressing the “favorites” tab.

4.You can delete the places in the “favorites” either by unselected the button in the detail view or by left swiping the cell in the favorites list.

5.I used a checking method between detail view from list and core data. So every time when you enter the detail view, the result will be checked whether it is already in the core data. Then the button will be “Add to favorites” if it is not and will be “In the favorites” if it is in the core data. Also you can see this change every time after you delete the result from the favorites.

6.Use the url and Json method of google places to replace the framework.

7.Handle the uidynamics well. You can see the instruction button falling from the top at first and then you are free to drag it everywhere on the main page. Press it to see the instructions.

Lessons Learned
=======================

Comparing the processing of finishing hw3 and hw1, I feel much better about iOS programming. It is becoming interesting to me.
